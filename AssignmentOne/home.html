            <div class="bannerinfo">New Zealand is a beautiful country located in the southern hemisphere. There are many iconic locations all across the country, however this site will be dedicated to the locations I have been lucky enough to visit in the North Island and share my experiences about. These images will not tell the full story of what these places have to offer, however it is a start and i'm hoping others can apreciate the divine nature shown. </div>
